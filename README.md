# Front-end wrapped

Stats and data from Gjensidige and front-end community in whole. Starting slide background 3D effect is a variation of the mouse Effect with Three.js demo from codrops - https://tympanus.net/codrops/2023/12/13/creating-an-interactive-mouse-effect-with-instancing-in-three-js/.

All the other stats-slides I created myself using mainly CSS to animate, sometimes JS to assist. The colorful backgrounds were taken from https://www.makeuseof.com/css-background-gradients/ and the "Show me more" button was taken from 
SVG on "Page 1" was a simple SVG created from code, inspired by https://www.section.io/engineering-education/javascript-canvas-piechart/
