## Credits

The starting page background 3D effect is a variation of a simple "rotating cubes" example from https://codepen.io/hootstheowl/pen/xOQVQg by HootsTheOwl. The other one worked locally but refused to work deployed to Github pages.

~~The starting page background 3D effect is a variation of the mouse Effect with Three.js demo from codrops - https://tympanus.net/codrops/2023/12/13/creating-an-interactive-mouse-effect-with-instancing-in-three-js/. I've titled the camera a bit, used our own color, and adjusted some minor details.~~

All the other pages I created myself using mainly CSS to animate, sometimes JS to assist. Setting up the pages were assisted by Github copilot, and from there I added on and adjusted to my hearts content, but many animations are hand-written.

The colorful backgrounds for all slides were taken from https://www.makeuseof.com/css-background-gradients/.

The CSS for the "Show me more" button was taken from https://getcssscan.com/css-buttons-examples.

The piechart on "Page 1" was a simple SVG created from code, inspired by https://www.section.io/engineering-education/javascript-canvas-piechart/.
